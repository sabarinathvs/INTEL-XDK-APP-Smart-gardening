   "description" : "This automatic watering system application allows you to set the watering schedule via a web page served directly from Intel® Edison, by using your mobile phone. It automatically checks moisture sensor data at periodic intervals, and displays this data on the web page. If the water pump is supposed to be on, but the water flow sensor does not detect that the pumping is talking place as expected, it sends a text message to a specified number through Twilio* so the watering system can be repaired. Optionally, it can also log watering system events using the Intel IoT Examples Datastore running in your own Microsoft* Azure* account.",
